    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>
      HTML is a language that our web browsers read to display the websites we are using. 
      Because a website has so many elements inside(buttons, texts, images, videos, etc.), HTML comprises various types of tags to 
      indicate how certain elements should be displayed. All the cool visuals displayed on this page are the result of HTML magic!

      I used to know the basics of the websites. But because I only knew the superficial things about them, I couldn't
      really do much in terms of creating my own website. I chose to enroll in this class so that I can
      learn more details about web designâ€” hopefully at the end of this class, I can finally 
      create a practical website with various features and aesthetic design.
